# NUMBER-GUESSING-GAME
The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive console-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard, which determine the number of attempts allowed for guessing the correct number.

# Features

1. Difficulty Levels: Players can choose between two difficulty levels:
  Easy: 10 attempts to guess the number.
  Hard: 5 attempts to guess the number.
2. Feedback on Guesses: After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct.
3. End Game Conditions: The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts, with appropriate messages displayed.
